Definition of Functions in java :-
=> Functions are the block of code that can be reused when required and basically inside the Functions we write the logic and when required we use them by calling.

syntax :-
returnType name(){
    //body
    return statement;
}


returnType = void , int , float , double etc.

by default the function name is -> main
It is also a keyword in the dictionary of java we cannot use it in any other function name.

What is Method?
-> when we write the functions inside the class they are called methods.


syntax with Parameters:-
returnType name(type parameter1 , type parameter2){
    //body
    return statement;
}


In java there is always the call by value means always the copy of the passed variable goes to the function there is no pass by reference in java .


Function overloading depends upon the no of parameters not on the return type but if we change the return type while keeping the no of parameters same it works.OO
